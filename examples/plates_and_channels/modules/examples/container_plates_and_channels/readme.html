<p>Comments are an essential part of any project. While it may often feel like the time it takes to leave a comment in your network slows down the flow of the project, leaving yourself a trail of breadcrumbs can help you find your way back to what you were thinking when you were first working. Comments are not only for the other programmers that you're collaborating with, they're also for your future self. At some point you're bound to come back to a project and need to decode what you were originally thinking. The more time has elapsed between your last commit, and opening your project again, the more likely you are to feel lost and enraged at what you find. Good documentation is always the best case scenario, but not always feasible. At the very least, you should always strive to leave at least a few bullet points about how your network functions, and the the logic behind your approach.
