<p>A network's re-usability lives and dies in its organization and structuring. While there are limits to a modular approach, it's well worth considering the larger implications around cultivating a forward focused temperament when building new systems. Every project will eventually come up against deadlines, changes orders, and the necessities of project delivery. To the best of our abilities, however, we might consider a tempered approach to thinking about how a particular element might be able to be used and re-used in future projects.

<h3>Do</h3>
<ul class="circle">
    <li>Break apart your networks into module pieces when possible</li>
    <li>Create easily visually navigable networks.</li>
    <li>Avoid mixtures of sizes, distributions, and complex nodal arraignments</li>
    <li>Think ahead - what organizational method best sets you up for success in the future?</li>
    <li>Limit the complexity of any given network - if you find a network is growing to be too sprawling, how might you re-organize or compartmentalize your implementation?</li>
    <li>Think of your work in terms of a test against the other members of the team - would this structure and approach pass an Elburz test?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Don't</h3>
<ul class="circle">
    <li>Make messes you never attend to - <b><i>"I'll clean it up later"</i></b> is the mantra of every creative coder at one point or another. If you have have enough time to have that thought, you have enough time to make a plan to refactor your code for a cleaner implementation.</li>
    <li>Be happy with your first draft - you built it fast and hard on the first pass to rough out the idea, but that shouldn't be good enough for the final implementation.</li>
    <li>Forget to ask for another set of eyes</li>
    <li>Forget to learn from your mistakes - we all make them, it's the joy of working on projects at large scales. It's okay to fall down, just remember to get up and avoid that same trap the next time around.</li>
    <li>Forget that you might not be the person to implement your code - we sometimes have to hand off a project to another team member, or are only in charge of developing a small piece of a larger project. There's a good chance that what you make will need to be decipherable by another team member. Don't assume that you will always be available to describe what's in your network - write it (and document it) so that another could pick it up, and continue with minimal effort.</li>
    <li>Forget to ask for help - we have one of the most remarkable TouchDesigner teams in the world - perhaps the most remarkable collection of them. There's a good chance that the answers are in the room.</li>
